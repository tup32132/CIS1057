    computer: a machine that can receive, store, transform, and output data of all kinds

    1.1 Brief History of Computers
        first computer was built in 1930s by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry to help studets with nuclear physics calculations

        The first large scale electronic digitical pc called the ENIAC was completed in 1946 at UPenn, funded by the US Army. 
        It was used to comput ballistics tables, predict weather and make atomic energy calcs.

        The CPU (Central processing Unit) is a small silicon chip that contained the circuitry for the computer processor

        personal pcs for one person, larger systems such as hotels banks use mainframers, which are larger and more reliable. 

        Supercomputers are larger and faster for intens applications such as weather forecasting 

        Hardware is all the equipment used to perform calculations such as the CPU, monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, graphics card

        Software is the programs that let us solve problems by giving the computer instructions. 

        Programming used to be done with long strings of binary (0 or 1) numbers. C makes programming easier

    1.2 Computer Hardware
        Most computers have
            main memory
            secondary memory like flash drive, hard disks
            CPU
            input devices (keyboard, mouse)
            output devices (screens, speakers)

        The user will input data with an input device into a program contained in the main memory or storage of a computer which will then be manipulated by the CPU which can store the results back on the memory which can be displayed on the output device. 

        Memory
            memory cells: an individual sotrage location in memroy
            
            address of a memory cell: the position of a memory cell in a computers main memroy 

            contents of a memory cell: the data stored in a cell, data or a program instruction

            stored program concept: the ability of a pc to store program instruction in memory for execution 

            memory cells are made up of small units. 

            Byte: the amount of storage needed for a single character
                The amount of these in each memory cell varies by computer 

            Bits: a binary digit, 0 or 1
                these make up bytes and is the smallest element a computer can deal with. 8 bits to each byte

            data storage: setting individual bits of a memory cell to 0 or 1, destroying the previous contents of the cell

            data retrieval: copying contents of a particular memory cell to another storage area for processing

            Main Memory is composed of two types
                Random Access Memory (RAM)
                    Offers temportary storage of data, programs, and resutls
                Read-Only Memory (ROM)
                    main memory part that stores programs and data permanently
                
                volatile memory: memory whose contents disappear when the pc is turned off. RAM is volatile memroy. 
            
            Secondary storage: units such as flash drives or disks that retain data even when power is off 

                disk: thin platter of mettal or plaster which data is represented by magnetized spots arranged in tracks

                optical driveL device that uses a laser to access or store data on a CD or DVD. 

                Flash drive: device that plugs into USB port stores data bits as trapped electrons

                files: a named collection of data stores on a disk
                
                directory: list of names of files stored on a disk (folder)

                subdirectory: a list of the names of files that relate to a particular topic
        
            petabyte > terabyte > gigabyte > megabyte > kilobyte > byte > bit 

        CPU 
            The CPU has two roles: coordinating all computer operations and performing arithmetic and logical operations on data

            follow instructions on a program to determine what to do and controls signals to other pc componenets. 

            fetching an instruction: retrieving instruction from main memory

            the memory inside a CPU is called the register, for instructions actively being operated. 

            multiprocessor is a computer with multiple CPUs for faster speeds

        Input and Output devices
            cursor: moving place marker on the screen

            function keys: special keys on keyboard for particular operation (ex: refresh page as F5)

            mouse/touchpad: input devices that move a cursor to select operations

            icon: a picture that represnets an operation

            the screen provides a tempory display, 

            hard copy: printed version of info, you should print it out.

        Computer Networks
            computers are linked togehter in networks so they can communicate

            Local area network (LAN): computers, printers, scanenrs, and storage devices connected by cables

            file server: the computer in a network that controls access to a secondary storage device such as a hard disk

            Wide area network (WAN): a network such as the itnernet that connects computers and LANS over a large geographic area
            
            The internet is the creation of the US defense ARPAnet project in 1969 which wanted to create a computer network that could operate ven if partially destroyed. 

            World Wide Web: a part of the itnernet whose graphical user interfaces make associated network resources easily navigable. 

            GUI: pictures and menus that are displayed to allow users to slect commands and data easier.

            modem: device that converts binary data to analog signals that can be transmitted between computers and over telephone lines 

            cable internet access: two way high speed transmission of internet data through two of the hundreds of channels over the coazzial cable that carries cable tv signals.
